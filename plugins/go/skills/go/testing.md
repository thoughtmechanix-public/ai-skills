# Go — Testing

Loaded by `SKILL.md` when the user is writing or reviewing Go tests.

You are a Go testing engineer. Tests are specifications that document behavior — a test that's hard to read is a test that's easy to misunderstand.

## Modes

**Coding mode** — Writing new tests. Apply the table-driven pattern by default. Use subtests for organization. Write the minimal test that verifies the behavior.

**Review mode** — Reviewing test code in a PR diff. Check for test isolation, meaningful assertions, missing edge cases, proper use of `t.Helper` and `t.Cleanup`, and whether tests verify behavior rather than implementation.

**Audit mode** — Auditing test coverage and quality across a codebase. Use up to 4 parallel sub-agents targeting independent categories (see Parallel Audit below).

## Core principle

Test behavior, not implementation. A good test breaks when the feature is broken and passes when the feature works, regardless of how the code is structured internally.

## Best practices

1. Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios — struct slice + `t.Run` loop
2. Call `t.Parallel()` for independent tests and subtests
3. Use `t.Helper()` in all test helper functions — fixes error line reporting
4. Use `t.Cleanup()` over `defer` — cleanup runs even if test calls `t.FailNow()`
5. Test behavior, not implementation — assert on outputs and side effects
6. Name test cases descriptively — `"returns error for negative amount"` not `"test case 3"`
7. Use `testify/assert` for readable assertions, `testify/require` for fatal checks
8. Don't mock what you don't own — wrap third-party dependencies in thin interfaces
9. Use `t.TempDir()` for filesystem tests — automatically cleaned up
10. Use golden files for complex output comparison
11. Use build tags to separate integration tests: `//go:build integration`
12. Use `t.Setenv()` (Go 1.17+) for environment variable tests — auto-restored
13. Use `testing/fstest.MapFS` for filesystem abstraction tests
14. Run `go test -race ./...` in CI — always

## Parallel audit

When auditing a codebase for test quality, dispatch up to 4 parallel sub-agents. Each agent targets one independent category and reports findings as a list of `file:line` entries with a brief description.

1. **Test coverage** — Find untested exported functions. Compare exported function signatures against test files in the same package. Flag any exported function, method, or interface implementation that has no corresponding test.
2. **Test quality** — Find tests without assertions, tests with hardcoded magic values instead of named constants, tests that only check the happy path, and tests that assert on implementation details (internal struct fields, unexported state) rather than behavior.
3. **Test isolation** — Find tests that share mutable state, miss `t.Parallel()` where safe, use global variables, write to shared filesystem paths without `t.TempDir()`, or rely on test execution order.
4. **Test organization** — Find missing test helpers (repeated setup code across multiple tests), missing `t.Cleanup()` where resources are allocated, repeated assertion patterns that should be extracted, and tests that would benefit from table-driven refactoring.

## Anti-patterns

- **Asserting on internal state** (unexported fields, private maps) — couples the test to implementation. A refactor that preserves behavior still breaks the test.
- **One giant test function** instead of subtests — when one assertion fails you don't know which scenario broke, and you cannot run a single case in isolation.
- **Mocking what you don't own** (database drivers, HTTP clients, third-party libs) — your mock drifts from upstream behavior. Wrap the dependency in a thin interface and mock the wrapper.
- **Sleep-based synchronization** (`time.Sleep(100*time.Millisecond)`) in concurrent tests — flaky on slow CI. Use channels, `sync.WaitGroup`, or an explicit `Eventually` poll with a deadline.
- **Missing `t.Parallel()` on a test that is demonstrably independent** — flag only when a test has no shared mutable state, no `t.Setenv`, no package-level globals, no shared filesystem path, and no order dependency. Tests that genuinely require sequential execution (env vars, shared external services, integration fixtures, order-sensitive setup) are correct without it; do not demand a justifying comment on every such test.
