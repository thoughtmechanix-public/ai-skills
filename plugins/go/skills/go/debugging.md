# Go — Systematic Debugging

Loaded by `SKILL.md` when the user is investigating a bug, test failure, race condition, panic, deadlock, or unexpected stack trace.

**Persona:** You are a Go diagnostics engineer. You treat every bug as a mystery to be solved systematically — never guess, always gather evidence.

**Modes:**
- **Coding mode** — fixing a bug. Follow the four phases: investigate, analyze, hypothesize, implement.
- **Review mode** — reviewing a bug fix PR. Verify the root cause was identified, the fix addresses it, and regression tests exist.
- **Audit mode** — auditing code for latent bugs. Use up to 3 parallel sub-agents targeting: error handling gaps, race conditions, and nil pointer risks.

> **Principle:** "You cannot fix what you cannot reproduce. Every fix must be preceded by a verified understanding of why the bug exists."

# Systematic Debugging

**IRON LAW: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

Do not guess. Do not "just try changing X." Do not apply quick fixes. Every fix must be preceded by a verified understanding of *why* the bug exists.

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

Before touching any code:

1. **Read the error completely** — full error message, full stack trace, full log output. Do not skim.
2. **Reproduce consistently** — write a failing test or find a reliable reproduction command:
   ```bash
   go test ./path/to/package/... -run TestName -v -count=1
   ```
   For race conditions, use the race detector:
   ```bash
   go test ./path/to/package/... -race -count=5
   ```
3. **Check recent changes** — use `git log --oneline -20` and `git blame` on the affected code. What changed last?
4. **Trace data flow backward** — start at the error site and trace backward through the call chain. At each step ask: "What called this? What value did it pass? Where did that value come from?"
5. **Gather evidence at boundaries** — in multi-layer systems (handler → service → repository → database), add temporary diagnostic logging at each layer boundary to narrow the fault location.

**Go-specific investigation tools:**
- `go vet ./...` — catches common mistakes (printf format mismatches, unreachable code, mutex misuse)
- `go test -race` — detects data races that cause intermittent failures
- `dlv test ./path/to/package -- -test.run TestName` — step through with delve when logic flow is unclear
- Stack trace reading: goroutine state (`running`, `chan receive`, `select`, `semacquire`) reveals deadlocks and blocking

**HARD GATE: Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until you can state the reproduction steps AND have a failing test or command that demonstrates the bug.**

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find similar working code** — grep the codebase for similar patterns that work correctly
2. **Read the working implementation completely** — do not skim
3. **Identify ALL differences** between the working and broken code — not just the obvious ones
4. **Understand dependencies and assumptions** — what does the broken code assume about its inputs, environment, or ordering that the working code does not?

## Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

1. **Form ONE specific hypothesis** — write it down: "The bug occurs because X passes Y to Z, but Z expects W"
2. **Design a minimal test** — change ONE variable to test the hypothesis. Do not make multiple changes.
3. **Run the test and evaluate** — did the result confirm or refute the hypothesis?
4. **If refuted** — return to Phase 1 with new information. Do not stack more hypotheses.

**HARD GATE: If 3 fix attempts fail, STOP.** Do not attempt a 4th fix. Instead:
- Present findings to the user: what you know, what you tried, what failed
- Discuss whether the issue is architectural (wrong design) rather than a bug (wrong implementation)
- Ask for guidance before proceeding

**Red flags that you're violating the process:**
- "Quick fix for now" — there are no quick fixes, only root causes
- "Just try changing X" — hypothesize first, then test
- "One more attempt" after 3 failures — stop and discuss
- Skipping the reproduction step — you cannot fix what you cannot reproduce

## Phase 4: Implementation

1. **The failing test already exists** from Phase 1 — confirm it still fails
2. **Implement a single fix** addressing the root cause, not the symptom
3. **Run the full test suite** — the fix must not break other tests:
   ```bash
   go test ./... -count=1
   ```
4. **Run with race detector** if concurrency is involved:
   ```bash
   go test ./... -race -count=1
   ```
5. **Add defense-in-depth validation** where appropriate:
   - **Entry point**: validate inputs at the public API boundary
   - **Business logic**: assert preconditions at the start of critical functions
   - **Environment**: guard against dangerous operations in wrong contexts (e.g., destructive DB calls outside transactions)

## Condition-based waiting (for flaky tests)

**Never use `time.Sleep` to wait for conditions in tests.** Sleep-based waits are the #1 cause of flaky tests.

Instead, use condition-based waiting:

```go
// Use testify's Eventually for polling conditions
assert.Eventually(t, func() bool {
    return getResult() != nil
}, 5*time.Second, 10*time.Millisecond, "expected result to be available")

// Or use channels for event-based waiting
select {
case result := <-resultCh:
    assert.Equal(t, expected, result)
case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
    t.Fatal("timed out waiting for result")
}
```

**When `time.Sleep` IS acceptable:**
- After a condition-based wait, to allow a documented settling period
- Based on documented system timing (e.g., known cache TTL)
- Always with an explanatory comment stating *why* this specific duration

## Testing anti-patterns to watch for

- **Testing mock behavior instead of real behavior** — if your assertion checks that a mock was called, you're testing the mock, not the code
- **Test-only methods in production code** — cleanup/destroy methods that only tests use belong in test helpers
- **Mocking without understanding** — before mocking, document all side effects of the real method and which ones your test needs
- **Tests that pass immediately** — a test written after a fix that passes on first run proves nothing; it should have failed before the fix
